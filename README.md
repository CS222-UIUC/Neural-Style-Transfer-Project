# Neural Style Transfer Website

Users are able to upload a picture to our web app which is processed and an output image is provided of the given picture that is rendered in the painting styles that are chosen. These styles will be chosen by the user, either by selecting from a bank of different artistic renditions or potentially by listing mood keywords that match the desired outcome. The users will then be able to save the picture or have the option to share it on social media.
